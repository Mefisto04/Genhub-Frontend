const knowledgeBase = `DermAI Assistant is an advanced AI-powered solution specifically designed for skin disease detection. It enables users to receive instant and accurate skin condition analysis by processing images uploaded directly or captured in real time through a mobile camera. At its core, the system uses a predictive model built on deep learning techniques—specifically a ResNet50 architecture with CrossEntropyLoss—which analyzes the image and provides a predicted result accompanied by precautionary recommendations. Although its current accuracy stands at 61%, this certified medical tool offers a valuable preliminary diagnostic insight that supports, but does not replace, professional dermatological advice. If users receive an incorrect result, they are advised to consult a qualified dermatologist for further verification and treatment, and they can also report any issues via the contact page on the website.

In terms of usage, DermAI Assistant is user-friendly: simply upload an image or use live scanning to receive a prompt analysis of your skin condition. The tool is capable of detecting a wide range of skin diseases, from common to rare conditions, and it even provides a probability score with each prediction to indicate the level of confidence in its results. It also offers a unique feature that displays a list of nearby doctors on a map, ensuring that users can easily find professional medical support when needed. Importantly, the assistant does not store any images, thereby maintaining user privacy and complying with healthcare regulations. Since the analysis is performed on cloud-based servers, an active internet connection is required to use the service, and currently, there is no dedicated mobile app available—only the web version is supported across various devices.

From a technical perspective, the model behind DermAI Assistant was trained using a comprehensive dataset of skin disease images. While it effectively differentiates between benign and severe conditions, continuous updates and enhancements are planned to increase both the number of detectable skin diseases and the overall accuracy of the system. Future developments may also include support for multiple languages, API integration with other healthcare systems, and even a dedicated mobile application, all of which aim to broaden its usability and impact. Additionally, user feedback plays a crucial role in the evolution of the tool, with a dedicated contact page available for reporting issues or suggesting improvements.

Overall, DermAI Assistant exemplifies the innovative application of AI in healthcare by providing rapid, accessible, and user-friendly skin condition analysis. It empowers individuals to take early action regarding their skin health while offering guidance on subsequent steps, such as consulting with healthcare professionals. Backed by GenHub Innovations—a company deeply committed to advancing technology and fostering digital transformation—DermAI Assistant is not only a practical tool for immediate skin disease detection but also a testament to the future of integrated, AI-driven medical diagnostics. Its continuous evolution and commitment to data privacy and user-centric design ensure that it will remain a significant asset in the field of digital healthcare.
